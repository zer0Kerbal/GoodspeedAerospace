description = A container of dense matter marketed for use in test weights, because we couldn't find a better use for it.  This 625mm diameter container weighs 100kg, and can hold an additional 1000kg (1 metric ton) of material. For your convenience while testing launch vehicles, it also contains a basic flight control computer and control moment gyroscopes.
