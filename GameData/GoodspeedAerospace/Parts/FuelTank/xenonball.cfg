manufacturer = Goodspeed Aerospace
description = Once the engineers at Goodspeed Aerospace realized that "xenon" was not the name of an evil alien dictator bent on depopulating Kerbin, they quickly started working on ways to use it for advanced spacecraft propulsion. The work on protecting volcanoes from atomic bombs continues, but with less funding. These tanks are available in five convenient sizes; right-click the tank after placement to choose the scale.
