title = SMD-250 Side Mount & Decoupler
manufacturer = Goodspeed Aerospace
description = The SMD-250, like most other decouplers, is equipped with a (hopefully) small explosive charge, that will sever the structural linkage between itself and whatever it's connected to.  Unlike most other radial decouplers, this one does not leave any unsightly residue on whatever it separates from.
