title = CMG-5 Robotic Control Unit
manufacturer = Goodspeed Aerospace
description = Tired of trying to control large rockets with small robotic brains designed for tiny probes, the engineers at Goodspeed Aerospace created a larger robotic control unit with a more powerful control moment gyroscope for extra attitude control.  However, it is heavier and consumes more power.
