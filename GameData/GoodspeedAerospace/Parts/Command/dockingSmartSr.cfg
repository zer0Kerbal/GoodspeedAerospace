title = Clamp-O-Tron SmartPort Sr.
manufacturer = Goodspeed Aerospace
description = The SmartPort Sr. integrates a Clamp-O-Tron docking port with a MicroQBE computer to create a docking port that you can place on a vessel and literally "control from here"!  Integrated RCS and a single-axis reaction wheel (roll-only) top out the feature list, making this a true all-in-one solution for your self-assembling space station modules.
