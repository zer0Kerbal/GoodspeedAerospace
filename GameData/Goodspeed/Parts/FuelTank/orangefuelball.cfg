title = Goodspeed FB-O Fuel Tank
manufacturer = Goodspeed Aerospace
description = Upon learning that spheres contain maximal volume per unit of surface area, and are inherently stronger at holding in pressurized contents, engineers at Goodspeed Aerospace began working on spherical fuel tanks in the hope of improving the wet/dry mass ratio of their tanks. These tanks are available in five convenient sizes; right-click the tank after placement to choose the scale.
